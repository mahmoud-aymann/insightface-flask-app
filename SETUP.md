# Setup Guide

## Required Files (Generated from Code)

The following files are **not included** in this repository because they are large and can be generated from the code:

### 1. Model Files

- **`Face_detection/weights/best.pt`** - YOLOv5 face detection model
  - **How to generate:** Run the training pipeline in `Face_Recognition_Pipeline.ipynb` (Steps 1-14)
  - **Size:** ~13-50 MB

- **`Face_detection/embeddings_raw.pkl`** - Face embeddings database
  - **How to generate:** Run the training pipeline in `Face_Recognition_Pipeline.ipynb` (Steps 1-14)
  - **Size:** Varies based on number of persons

- **`Face_detection/insightface/buffalo_l/`** - InsightFace models
  - **How to generate:** Automatically downloaded when you first run InsightFace
  - **Size:** ~100-200 MB total
  - **Note:** These are downloaded automatically by InsightFace library

### 2. Video File

- **`demo_video.mp4`** - Demo video (optional)
  - **How to add:** Record your own demo video or upload to YouTube
  - **Size:** Varies

## Quick Start

### Option 1: Download Pre-trained Models (Recommended)

Download the required model files from Google Drive:

**🔗 [Download Models from Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1uUGziBy7ArD8kcmJk_56Y_W0NUsn-76U?usp=sharing)**

The folder contains:
- `best.pt` - YOLOv5 face detection model
- `embeddings_raw.pkl` - Face embeddings database
- `insightface/` - InsightFace models (ONNX format)

**After downloading:**
1. Place `best.pt` in `Face_detection/weights/best.pt`
2. Place `embeddings_raw.pkl` in `Face_detection/embeddings_raw.pkl`
3. Place `insightface/` folder in `Face_detection/insightface/`
4. Run the Flask app: `python app.py`

### Option 2: Generate Everything from Scratch

1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Run the training pipeline:**
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   # Open Face_Recognition_Pipeline.ipynb
   # Run all cells (Steps 1-14)
   ```

3. **InsightFace models will download automatically** when you first use InsightFace

4. **Run the Flask app:**
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

### Option 3: Use Your Own Pre-trained Models

If you have your own pre-trained models:

1. **Place `best.pt` in:** `Face_detection/weights/best.pt`
2. **Place `embeddings_raw.pkl` in:** `Face_detection/embeddings_raw.pkl`
3. **Place InsightFace models** in `Face_detection/insightface/buffalo_l/` (or they will download automatically)

## Directory Structure After Setup

```
insightface_github_complete/
├── Face_detection/
│   ├── weights/
│   │   └── best.pt              # Generated from training
│   ├── embeddings_raw.pkl       # Generated from training
│   └── insightface/            # Auto-downloaded by InsightFace
│       └── buffalo_l/
│           ├── *.onnx files     # Auto-downloaded
│           └── ...
└── ...
```

## Notes

- All model files can be generated by running the training pipeline
- InsightFace models are downloaded automatically (no manual download needed)
- The training pipeline will create all necessary files
- Sample data is included in `data/` folder for testing
